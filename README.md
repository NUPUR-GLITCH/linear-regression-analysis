# Linear Regression Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Simple Linear Regression** using Python.  
The analysis is performed on a time-series dataset (monthly passenger data) to understand trends and relationships between variables.

The notebook explains:
- Difference between **Simple Linear Regression** and **Linear Regression**
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Visualization of results
